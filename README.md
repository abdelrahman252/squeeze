## Why Squeeze?

Most compression tools make you juggle separate apps for video, audio, images, and PDFs. Squeeze handles all four in a single drag-and-drop queue. Everything runs **100% locally** , your files never leave your machine.

| | |
|---|---|
| **No uploads, ever** | All compression runs locally using FFmpeg, Ghostscript, and native Rust libraries. Your files stay yours. |
| **Bilingual & RTL** | Full Arabic & English support with native Right-to-Left layout flipping for a comfortable bilingual experience. |
| **Light & Dark Theme** | Fluid light and dark theme styling with persistent preference savings. |
| **Secure Auto-Updates** | Integrates built-in, secure app updater checks directly from GitHub Releases. |
| **Hardware-accelerated video** | Automatically uses your NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD GPU for video encoding , no manual setup needed. |
| **One queue, every format** | MP4, MKV, MOV, MP3, FLAC, JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, and PDF , all in one drop zone. |

## Features

### Unified Drop Zone
Drop any mix of file types at once. Squeeze detects each format and routes it to the correct engine automatically. Filter by kind using the chips above the queue , or just squeeze everything at once.

### Per-File Precision
Set a specific target size on individual files right inside the queue row , e.g. exactly 8 MB for a Discord upload , without changing the global preset for the rest of the batch.

### Bilingual (EN/AR) & Light Mode
Toggle between English and Arabic with full Right-to-Left (RTL) layout support, and swap themes dynamically using theSun and Moon header buttons. Your configuration is automatically persisted.

### Secure Auto-Updates
When launching, Squeeze checks for signed releases on GitHub and prompts you to update automatically so you always have the latest tools.

### Three Plain-English Presets
**Less Compression** · **Recommended** · **Extreme Compression**. No CRF values, no bitrate sliders, no jargon. Recommended is the default and hits the best quality-to-size balance for almost every file.

### "Already Optimal" Detection
If compressing a file would make it *larger*, Squeeze stops and marks it as **Already optimal** rather than wasting your time with a bloated output.

### Instant Retry
Failed job? Hit the retry button directly on the queue row. No need to re-add the file or re-run the whole queue.

### Before / After Preview
A visual slider lets you compare the original and compressed output side by side, with exact file sizes displayed under each label.
